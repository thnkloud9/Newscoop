    tip: 'In Newscoop, topics are the subject matters assigned by editors and journalists to articles, so that related articles can be identified and displayed together. A root topic can have many subtopics; for example: the sports root topic could have the subtopics football, basketball, and water polo. An individual article may have several root topics or subtopics assigned to it.'
